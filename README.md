# TalentSage QA Automation Framework
## Overview
This automation framework tests the TalentSage Recruitment Operating System using Playwright with TypeScript following Page Object Model . The framework supports both UI and API testing with a focus on maintainability and reliability.

# Automated Modules 
# AuthModule (Registration)
This include filling registration form and verify registraion 
# Hompage Visits 
This include just visit Home page and verify home page 
# Api Autmation
# POST Request on dummy Api
# Get Request on dummy Api 

# Goal 
The Goal of  Autmation is to automate repetitive Tasks As registration is always repeating and most importand module . Hence I automate it . It helps in time saving and Quality Improvement .. 

## Why We Automated These Tests

- **Save Time**: Run tests in minutes instead of hours of manual testing
- **Catch Bugs Early**: Automated tests run on every code change
- **Consistency**: Tests run the same way every time, reducing human error
- **Fast Feedback**: Developers know immediately if something breaks
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensures new changes don't break existing features
- **CI/CD Integration**: Tests run automatically in the deployment pipeline

**Business Impact:**
- Every broken application = lost candidate = lost potential hire
- Automated testing catches issues before candidates do
