## 🚀 Why We Automated These Tests

- **Save Time**: Run tests in minutes instead of hours of manual testing
- **Catch Bugs Early**: Automated tests run on every code change
- **Consistency**: Tests run the same way every time, reducing human error
- **Fast Feedback**: Developers know immediately if something breaks
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensures new changes don't break existing features
- **CI/CD Integration**: Tests run automatically in the deployment pipeline

**Business Impact:**
- Every broken application = lost candidate = lost potential hire
- Automated testing catches issues before candidates do
